Jul15 : Started understanding Manual Instrumentation and Traces. Started looking into Observability Backend. Understood how to use Jaeger. Checked Qwickle to see how telemetry was handled there (log in firebase, fb etc. Don't know where this data was read and analyzed at.)

#dailyWork  
Jul16 : started with implementing nodeJS auto instrumentation for example app and used jaeger since it is simple to use. then tried to do it in orker client app but it did not work. realised i should be using browser instrumentation and not nodeJS. Learnt and implemented that. Got CORS trouble and implemented collector for that but not working correctly yet. Basic working model done ans sent a video in group.
