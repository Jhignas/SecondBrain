What happens when you sit still?
What happens when you stop running?
When you just sit and entertain yourself?

At this age, I feel the time passing through me. I see it pass and every grain of sand that falls increases the despair in me.

The only thing I can think of that'll keep me away from this abyss id running.
Just working and running non stop through this sandstorm of time. It'll make me feel good.
I will feel like I've moved & that I've kept up with all I could.
I'm just not tired enough to stop.
