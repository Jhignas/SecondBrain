1. Listen to what everyone says. You **DO NOT** have to follow them. Do what you think is right.
2. Do not lie, it is a bigger headache and it will never end good.
3. Marry when you know why you're marrying. Do not do it because everyone is doing it.
4. Have a clear reason for the things you are doing. Everything you do has to be by your reason. You cannot depend on people to stand by you for your actions even if they were taken by those people's directions. You are alone responsible for your actions.
