### Memories of the Temple
"[[Bahamut]], the Dragon God of Honour & Justice, was in a momentous battle with her anti-thesis and sister [[Tiamat]], when a scale from our Goddess broke off and fell to these lands we now call our home. That was before us, before our ancestors, even before our peaks and valleys but when our forebearers came across this land they knew the power it held and built this temple which we honour to this day" said XXX Verglas, pointing to the temple atop the hill they were ascending.

Young Lilo, holding her mother XXX's hand was too engrossed with the festivities around her to properly pay attention to her mother's history lesson. And who could blame her, it was the [[Day of the Crossing]] after all, the day when [[Moon Eldrion |Eldrion]] & [[Red Moon]] cross each other's path and switch sides, the day when [[Red Moon]] comes over to their side, the day when the [[Verglas Clan]] gets the command of the temple. People were ecstatic for this once in 2 years festivity. The whole town had come alive for the event. 
On the curving path to the hilltop, Lilo gazed at the [[Seneki River]], the calm flow of the waters made no sense as she could still hear the loud and thunderous gushing of the water even with the festivities abound. 
The river made its way inside the mountain they were ascending and as Lilo reached the summit, she could see where the water went.

The water came out of the mountain on the other side with such a thunderous sound, the waters roaring, cascading and so frothy that it looked like a dragon was spewing it out. The name of the temple, [[Dragon's Breath Temple| Dragon's Breath]] made complete sense now. 
A humungous but peaceful river on one side, [[Mount Lengse]] on top of it, and a torrent reminiscent of a dragon's breath on the other, this formed the border between the [[Verglas Clan | Verglas]] territory and their rival clan, the tailless [[Adachi Clan | Adachis]].

Next year too, there would be celebrations but the tone would be more somber and fiery and a show of pride since [[Lord Verglas]] would have to hand the control back to the [[Adachi Clan]].

### Growing up with Brothers
You only had 2 elder brothers, the twins, %%Name & Name'%%, until all of you were introduced to '%%Name3%%', a scrawny human, elder to you but younger than your brothers. Your mother said he was your brother from today, and just like that, you had another.

### Meeting the Prince
You enjoy being at places where you aren't supposed to be. Sneaking around the castle and playing in discrete and 'off the beaten path' areas of the kingdom.

On one such day near the [[Seneki River]] you come across a boy, a dragonborn, wandering there too.
	>This is Prince Adachi, the heir of the Adachi clan, (though you don't realise it at the time). You tell me how that incident went and how you eventually became friends. After that day you met several times and became quite good friends.

As you grow up, you eventually understand the differences and the hatred between the clans and the underlying racism between the tailed and tail-less dragonborns.
	How you overcome this and how your relation with the Prince matures is your call.

### The Monks Arrive
A group of monks visit the kingdom to pay their respects at the Dragon's Breath Temple and stay at the castle as the guests of the sovereign. You meet a girl your age accompanying the monks and become friends with her.
This is the girl who gives you shelter when you eventually runaway.

### The Year unto the Runaway
Over the course of the year that leads up to the dreadful night when you flee your country, you come across various incidents that make you uneasy even at your young age. You overhear few conversations among the elders due to your nature of sneaking around the castle and the gossiping maids give you the reasons behind your father's tense and worried demeanor lately.
He's been absent a lot and your mother's health taking a downturn does not help in these troubled times.

The tensions at the border seem to be boiling up. The incidents of skirmishes along the border have been of the rise and this has put the military on high alert.

The resources in the country, especially the grain seems to be falling short, surprisingly despite the successful harvest & trading season. The stockpiling of rations by the military due to the situation at the border is not helping.

###### **_7 months before the runaway_**
Minister of Whispers, %% Some Name  1%%, has been informing of the rising civil unrest.
Lord Verglas on the other hand is too busy to look into it directly since he's handling the border skirmishes personally.

%% Some Name 2 %%, the official news bearer of the kingdom, the one who delivers  the king's voice to the people seems to be working diligently to keep the people calm and their spirits up.

###### **_5 months before the runaway_**

Minister of Whispers, %% Some Name  1%%,  disappears.

Mother's health worsens.

###### _3 months before the runaway_

There is a riot and loot at  the rationing station in the city. Anarchy is slowly taking root.

###### **_1 months before the runaway_**

There kingdom is hit with the news of kidnapping of the [[Adachi Clan | Adachi]] Prince.
The [[Adachi Clan]] issues an ultimatum to the kingdom to return the Prince or face their wrath.
Proving that your kingdom had nothing to do with is not only difficult due to the already high tensions but due to the pride and ego of the clans.

###### **_5 days before the runaway_**

Lilo finds the prince. She remembers the prince being the captive of a mysterious figure that she hadn't seen before. She remembers the figure being a dragon with a devilish visage. She remembers asking them to set him free. She remembers making a deal. She remembers... nothing more.
###### **_The Night of the Runaway_**

With the knowledge that the Adachi prince has been returned, you get into a peaceful sleep that had been missing die to the tensions around the castle in the last few weeks.

"Lilo! Lilo wake up."
You are jolted awake by your mother's tense voice who is now lifting you up and pulling you by your hands. You see a blur of your brothers by her side. They look scared.
You walk out of the room to find, 

"Maa, what's going on?"
** Crashing Thud. Noises of a crowd.

"Shhh Lilo, keep your voice down and follow."

You see Theodock Shadowclaw, the Kings Guard, along with a few soldiers waiting outside your door.  
  
They usher you down the corridor.  
  
You are attacked on your way out by what you only describe as mutated civilians.  
  
You understand that an angry mob is attacking the castle.  
You are told that you are going to the port to flee to a undisclosed location for your safety.  
  
You are too afraid to ask about your father's whereabouts.  
  
The soldiers accompanying you dwindle as they are being taken down one by one and stay back to help you escape.  
  
On one such unfortunate encounter your mother falls victim to a sudden blow. Theodock engages them urging the four of you to flee.  
  
Near the dockyard, a group of mob starts closing down on you.  
  
One of your twin brother jumps to take a blow that would have taken you down, spelling his end.

Your two brothers rush you towards a ship and ask you to jump into the cargo holder, hiding you from the mob.

The last thing you see is both of them running in two different directions to lead the mob away from you.
