Mirja belong to the [[Earth Ashari]].
One day Mirja 's grand mother [[Karifa Trix |Karifa]] reaches out to her to tell her this:
###### The Message
"This isn't the first time that [[Earth Ashari#The Petrification| the petrification]] has breached the rift. Our tribe had to handle this in the early years of our founding too, and it was too great a task for us then, as it is for us now. The records speak of a band of magi that made their way here during that period. A band of magi that helped us stop the petrification. When they took their leave, they left a cryptex with us, a message from a diviner among them. This is what it held." And handed you a small parchment of sorts.
