Starwind 

Talia Starwind, born under Eldrion's enchanting moonlight, navigated a childhood marked by emotional distance. Her elven mother, Lyra, entranced by her own allure, overlooked Talia's needs, while Aric, her human bard father, was lost in ancient ballads. Yearning for connection, Talia left her sheltered life to embark on a quest for identity.
Discovering a guild of arcane artisans, Talia honed her magical abilities and became a formidable bard. Embracing her motto, "The world is a song, waiting to be sung. And I, Talia, am its bard," she set forth as a wanderer, challenging norms and reshaping reality with her resilient and authentic heart. She has a soft spot for young souls trying to find their place in society and tries her best to be a guide in some way when given the chance.

The voice told me about a very specific recurring dream I had when I was 10 years old, about a moonstone lyre in what looked like an enchanted forest that when strummed, played the most beautiful sound that sounded like a brook. The voice said that this lyre had an important connection with my past, and all would be revealed in time, should I come to the location it asked me go to.
