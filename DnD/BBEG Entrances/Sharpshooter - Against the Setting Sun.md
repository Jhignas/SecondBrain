On a fine evening, you are being attacked with arrows/bullets. You try to see where they are coming from but you can't find anyone nearby. 
As you are searching, you hear another whizzing noise and as soon as you turn in that direction you see an arrow coming towards you, as if right out from the setting sun. 

You finally manage to go towards the oncoming arrows and you notice a shadow against the sun.
A silhouette of a marksman is taking you down but decides to show mercy and let's you live.
