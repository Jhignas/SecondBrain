A card that can be used as a reaction to change your fate.

Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use this card to roll an additional d20. You can choose to use this card after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined.

You can also use this when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20 and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours.
