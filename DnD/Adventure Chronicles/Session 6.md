After coming out of the [[Knelling Goods & Stuff]], they decide to go to the [[The Late Night Spark]] separately so as to not be suspicious since the bandits are searching for them.

[[Lilomelia Verglas|Lilo]] takes the longer route. [[Mirja Trix|Mirja]] makes a beeline. [[Talia Starwind|Talia]] decides to give a performance at the crossroads attracting attention of not only the locals and the guards *but also the bandits*.

[[Talia Starwind|Talia]] is asked casually by the guard to make time to meet the captain of the town's guard as their are bandits looking about for them.

At the [[The Late Night Spark |Tavern]] they learn about a [[Talisso Oakenhull]], a woodworker in the town who might have some work for them.

They meet [[Yefiz Offodel]] who asks for their help and offers 30gp each if they can hold off the threats until he finishes his reading. 
He also offered [[Talia Starwind|Talia]] a [[Wand of Magic Missiles]] and [[Pearl of Power Storing]]. She chooses the latter.

After this they decide to make their way to the captain of the guard and notice that [[Knelling Goods & Stuff]] is closed on the way. When they make their way to their destination, they see that [[Bosun Knelling]] and [[Kaistubh The Wandering Merchant.png]], the one who they attacked are in a conversation with one who visibly looks like the captain, [[Gunnora Talmund]].
