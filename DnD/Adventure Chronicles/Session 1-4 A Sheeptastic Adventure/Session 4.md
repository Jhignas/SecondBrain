Talia and Mirja are both down, about to be hit by the dragon's breath weapon when
Khali comes and slices Ahmed in half, dismantling the dragon to be just pieces of bed and the wood spider to fall apart as well.

They defeat [[Ahmed Noke]] and successfully restore Fenrir back to his elf form.
Fenrir mourns for a moment looking at Ahmed's body and walks into his tower. He is tired and sad about how things turned out and fill the party in on how everything happened, shows a bit of remorse on his part about the way he handled his human apprentice.

Regarding the reward, he shows them the tower and tells them that Ahmed had left nothing of value in the tower using everything for his studies.

He instead gives them a written bond of 1000GP to be collected in either of 2 towns, one coastal trade hub and the other being a miner's town in a mountain.

He also gives them the freedom to take anything they want from the tower itself.

Our party takes [[Cloak of Billowing]], [[Doublet of Dramatic Demise]] and a spell scroll of *Identify*.
