They debate for a long time on how to hide the body and end up taking the body outside and making a " #RedFountain " out of the bodies. 
They finally get a cart and get eh bodies onto a cart and make a move towards the tower.

They meet a travelling merchant who tries to sell them wares and a few magical items like [[Everburning Torch]], [[Mighty Acorn]].

When no deal is made, the merchant (whose name is [[Yonbir]]) makes a move but Khali threatens him with his axe.

Looking at this, the bandits who were lying in wait attack but lose.

[[Yonbir]] slides away during this conflict.
