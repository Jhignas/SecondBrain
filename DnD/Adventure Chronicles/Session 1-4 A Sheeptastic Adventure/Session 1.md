All the characters are invited to the inn [[The Laughing Hippogriff]], on the outskirts of [[Hrisham]], in a dream promising them what they desire the most.

[[Talia Starwind|Talia]] who has already been in the inn for sometime notices [[Lilomelia Verglas|Lilo]] slowly crawling in (Lilo wanted to remain unnoticed) and does not waste a second before attacking what looks like a lizard on a wall.
After a small altercation between [[Talia Starwind|Talia]] and [[Lilomelia Verglas|Lilo]], which is interrupted by the innkeeper [[Garmini Whistlebrook]], they are all given a room to stay at the inn for the night.

At the dawn of the day, they are all woken up by a ramming at the door. [[Khali]] opens up the door just in time to let the sheep which was ramming the door to tumble in due to the sudden removal of its intended object of ramming. 
They notice that the sheep is carrying a scroll in its mouth and upon inspection figure out that it is a spell scroll of "Speak with Animals".

[[Talia Starwind|Talia]] uses the scroll to cast the spell which leads to the sheep introducing themself as [[Fenrir Shinebright]], a well known wizard of the area. He goes on to tell of their apprentice [[Ahmed Noke]] 's betrayal, his eventual escape and asks them to help change themself back to their original body.

Around this time they hear footsteps around the hall, a grumbling voice asking around for a sheep. Realising that these must be Noke's henchmen, they hide Shinebright below the bed.

A Half Orc and a hooded figure make their way into the room looking for [[Fenrir Shinebright|Fenrir]]. The Half Orc introduces himself as Guz. Though Guz believes their deception that the sheep ran through the window at first but gets angry as soon as he realises that he's being played with. A battle breaks out and to the surprise of the party, the hooded figure transforms into a wolf and attacks [[Khali]]. The party make swift work of their foes. [[Khali]] beheads the wolf and [[Mirja Trix|Mirja]] transforms into a squirrel and starts biting Guz's eyes before killing him.

They turn back to the sheep to question him only to realise that the spell has worn off and all they can hear now is bleating.
