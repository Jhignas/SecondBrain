They start by making the #RedFountain No.2 in front of the tower using Ahmed and the wolves bodies.

They also realise that they lost one health potion which was on the cart to the dragons attack.

When they camp on their way back to town, [[Mirja Trix|Mirja]] notices that someone/thing came close to the camp and sent them skittering away when she sent a bow flying towards them.

Lilo gets an abstract dream of her past, of the time she finds the [[Adachi Clan |Adachi]] Prince in the dungeon. She hears the figure made of Shadow Mist say "Your bidding will be done and the price you pay will be a stroke of luck for me". She wakes up gasping.

Mirja sees Lilo struggling in her sleep and eventually her waking up gasping. She ties herself to Lilo just to be safe.

Talia wakes up for her watch and says that she dreamed of mice!.

They start back to town and see the Statue of the [[Chance Taker]], a young boy, leaning on a tall walking stick with a smirk on his face and a sling back worn across his shoulders. "Blessing be on your travels" is written on the pedestal. Upon close inspection they see an intricately carved sling bag and see that it contains a  map of the coastal part of the continent on it. It is neither a flat surface depicting the valleys and plateaus of the region. They notice an intricately marked dot and wonder about its significance, which is the temple of the Chance Taker on the hill which they are ignorant of.

At this point, [[Khali]] who is standing back near the cart is gobbled up by the kitten on his shoulder and disappears. Mirja notices as some dark portal encloses on Khali and vanishes. They wonder what to do and when nothing fruitful happens, they continue to make their way into the town.

They reach the town and decide to go to the Apothecary, [[Black's Herbs & Remedies]]. They find some stuff they want like healing potions, poisons, acids. Lilo asks for some shroom drugs and sleeping potions. They then try to scam her by promising her the recipe for the so called [[Invisibility Potion]] for all of the items they want to purchase which come to around 484GP. She gets irritated and asks them to leave.

They make their way to [[Knelling Goods & Stuff]]. They notice someone other than the owner of the shop heaving behind the counter. They choose to ignore it and go on with their business. They purchase a few things. [[Lilomelia Verglas|Lilo]] gets the [[Mighty Acorn]]. [[Mirja Trix|Mirja]] gets a sickle and a sledgehammer. They get out of the shop.
