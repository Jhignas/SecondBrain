DEAD
Former apprentice of [[Fenrir Shinebright]]

Ahmed once hero-worshipped Shinebright and served as his apprentice for many years.

However, as time dragged on and on there was never any change in their relationship. Decades passed and still the master transmuter treated him like a child, expected to cook, clean and recite answers by rote. When Noke pressed him on it, Shinebright would explain that his was how he had been taught, and didn’t seem to register Noke’s claims that, as a human, he couldn’t spare a century to serve out an apprenticeship. At the same time, Noke began to realise that much of Shinebright’s acclaim came not from his own abilities  as they were- but from the Wand of True Polymorph he wielded.
Eventually he cracked, and turned on his former master before setting himself up as a master wizard.

However, a combination of guilt and suddenly unstoppered ambition spelled bad news for his mental state. He is paranoid that someone will attack him as he attacked Shinebright and rarely sleeps. This paranoia has led him to invest in a troop of guards, many of whom he has transmuted into stronger, more bestial forms.
