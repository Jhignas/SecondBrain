Over the course of history, very few issues have been recorded from the Earth elemental rift. Except for a few problems faced by the Earth Ashari during the early decades of their formation, and another major event in the 2nd century since the founding, no other altercations had been recorded.

The Earth Ashari, originally a tribe of fierce warriors who tamed the wilds around the rift and made home in the harsh environment of the mountains, slowly faced the same fate of any army which hasn't seen war in centuries. They changed.

The change was in no way immediate. Centuries upon centuries of peace and no action from the rift, meant no use for the armies/warriors. The traditions and rituals to keep the rift safe were slowly taking a hit too.

Initially it was only a few people who had realised the potential of the forests and the mountains that surrounded them and taken up trade with the neighbouring nations and towns, but it wasn't long before the town bustled into a hub for trade and started to gain the notice of the most powerful nations in the world. It was on its way to become one itself.

The power in this new Kingdom was held by the Ministry of Trade and other such Civic Powers and though there was still an office held and kept for the Management/protection of the rift and the rituals to keep the rift safe… it had long been just a namesake office.

## The Petrification

The problem began when the rift started vibrating again. Though it had alerted the people closest to the rift and the ones who still believed in their old ways of life, this was not enough to scare the head of this sect, much less bother the council.

The vibrations slowly but surely had transformed into minor tremors which though not intense, surely travelled far. This raised the alarm of the caretaker  [[Karifa Trix]], your grandmother. She started investigating it personally, but the progress was slow as the support from the head of the ministry was non-existent.

Eventually, there was a breakthrough in her investigation, a record of the problem faced by the tribe in the second century of their founding. What had begun as a slow hum from the rift had started a terrible sickness in the forests around it.

[[Karifa Trix]], along with a few of her subordinates, followed the tremors only to find the sickness take hold again, Petrified Trees. 

[[Karifa Trix |Karifa]] appeared before the council and informed them of the petrification personally, telling them how this wasn't the first time it was happening, but the council was as good as deaf to her warnings. The council was more worried about how this news would create panic among the populace and panic was never good for trade. 

Decision was made to bury the news of petrification so it wouldn't reach the public and [[Karifa Trix |Karifa]] was asked to calm down about the issue and let the council take the appropriate measures. She knew what this meant. No news could be covered if people who knew about it were let to roam the kingdom free. Her fears were right. It wasn't late before her subordinates started disappearing. She did the only thing she could think of, reach out to her grand daughter [[Mirja Trix]] with [[Mirja Trix#The Message | the message]].
