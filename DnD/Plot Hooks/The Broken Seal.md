stolen from:  Frieren : Beyond Journeyâ€™s End
On their travels, they find a village with a statue of a monster on the outskirts. They get to know that it is an actual monster that had been sealed away by a group of adventurers about half a century ago. It might be breaking sometime soon and that's why the people of the town are uneasy and few have already starting to leave the town.

If they come back, they find half of the town deserted.
Otherwise, they hear about some monster creating havoc in those parts.
