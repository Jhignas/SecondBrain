A devil and a chromatic black dragon are in cahoots to destroy both the kingdoms around [[Dragon's Breath Temple]], effectively making the temple a desolate place.

The chromatic dragon want the riches of these kingdoms for themself. They are very greedy and very ambitious.

The Devil is a minion of Tiamat herself. A blow to this very important temple of Bahamut is always welcomed by the Chromatic Goddess.
Also, a scale of [[Bahamut]] is rumored to be in the temple. This artifact will be very powerful in the eventual rituals to free Tiamat.

The capture of the Prince of the [[Adachi Clan]] was part of the duo's plan to get the two kingdoms to war.
Lilomelia finding them and making the deal came as a surprise blessing effectively removing the Verglas clan from the equation and completely weakening one of the Kingdom.
