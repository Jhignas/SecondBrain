The Earth Ashari were once before troubled by the petrification problem that is looming over their kingdom now. In the second century since their founding, when they faced the same issue, a group of travelling wizards had come to their nation and helped them out of that situation, or so the lore goes. This was during the Age of Arcanum.

Mirja is given a scroll by her Grandmother [[Karifa Trix]], which was apparently left by that group of mages foreseeing such a troubled time. It read as follows:

"In the presence of the [[Chance Taker]] atop the hill,
See through the pillars of creation to find the till,
A mark on the closest star you'll find it to be,
The serpent's forked tongue will lead you to ye."

There are temples dedicated to the [[Chance Taker]] in the most desolate and very obscure regions of the world and that's what he inspires and asks people to do.
When standing near one such temple, you can  see the [[Pillars of Creation]].
And when looking through these stone structures, you can see an island against the setting sun, just like a small black dot.

The mages are on this island solving a particular issue or were recently there.
