You hear a growl or wings flapping or thousands of birds chirping loudly ( screaming ), or something unusual which makes you look in the direction with anticipation.

and you see a flock of glittering and radiant small little birds/sparrows fly in , it is just magical. and as they rush in, you see a few hit the building around you and fall down or some come shooting down just like shooting meteors.

When you pick one up and see, you see charred bodies. They were lit on fire and were flying for their lives, those were not chirps, they were screams of anguish, of pain.
