Villains have motivations.

You can pick from one of the seven cardinal sins to decide what emotion led them astray.
Pride, Greed, Lust, Envy, Gluttony, Wrath, Sloth

Stories can exist without a villain. You can work on something happening or you can also work to stop something from happening.
But Villains can make things happen. They are active. They make the plot move. They do things which challenge the heroes. They are the only NPC whose prominence is as important as the PCs.

What Not To Do ([Pointy Hat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GP04EzrD9Q)) :

Do not make the villain an "Evil Lamp".  Similar to the "Sexy Lamp", an evil lamp villain just sits in their lair/throne etc and just shed evil. They can be replaced by an evil lamp.  Sauron in the LOTR series and Scar in the second half of The Lion King are evil lamps. They are not active.

Villains cannot be too big for the story. If they are too big, PCs don't care about them since they cannot deal with them and they know you will not throw the villain at them since they are too powerful. Villains thoughts can be huge. They cannot have the skills bigger than the plot.

Avoid twist villains. They are not worth it in DnD. Twist villains are good if the players have enough knowledge to figure it out on their own. If they were not given enough opportunities to figure it out, the reveal will simply fall flat. In case they figure it out, they will have to sit through 4 sessions of 4 hours each before they get validation or a boring reveal by that point. it is very different from figuring it out in a 2 hour movie with an hour left.

What To Do:
The villain should be active. They need to oppose the PCs actively.
The villain should be present. They need to meet the villain enough or at least meet the villains minions.
The villains needs to be personal.
