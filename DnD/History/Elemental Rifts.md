The world as we know it, along with all its moons and stars is known to exist in what we call the "Material Plane". This plane of ours is said to be surrounded by the "Elemental Planes" of fire, air, water & earth.Â 

There are four known rifts in reality, opening a doorway to each of these elemental realms. The existence of these doorways posed a threat to our world, since there were always entities that had crossed over into this realm and caused havoc among its populace.

To protect our world from the dangers of the elemental planes, 4 tribes were created, one to protect each of the rifts; and together they were known as the [[Ashari]].
