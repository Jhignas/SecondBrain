A town in midst of the thick forest covered mountains of the western [[Sindhula]].

Due to being covered in such a way, the town does not get sunlight till much later in the day. Hence, the townsfolk set up a huge mirror on one of the mountains so that the sunlight may reflect and illuminate their town.
