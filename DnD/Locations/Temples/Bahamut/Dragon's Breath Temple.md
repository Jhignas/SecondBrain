"[[Bahamut]], the Dragon God of Honour & Justice, was in a momentous battle with her anti-thesis and sister [[Tiamat]], when a scale from our Goddess broke off and fell to these lands we now call our home. That was before us, before our ancestors, even before our peaks and valleys but when our forebearers came across this land they knew the power it held and built this temple which we honour to this day" said XXX Verglas, pointing to the temple atop the hill they were ascending.

Young Lilo, holding her mother XXX's hand was too engrossed with the festivities around her to properly pay attention to her mother's history lesson. And who could blame her, it was the [[Day of the Crossing]] after all, the day when [[Moon Eldrion |Eldrion]] & [[Red Moon]] cross each other's path and switch sides, the day when [[Red Moon]] comes over to their side, the day when the [[Verglas Clan]] gets the command of the temple. People were ecstatic for this once in 2 years festivity. The whole town had come alive for the event. 
On the curving path to the hilltop, Lilo gazed at the [[Seneki River]], the calm flow of the waters made no sense as she could still hear the loud and thunderous gushing of the water even with the festivities abound. 

The river made its way inside the mountain they were ascending and as Lilo reached the summit, she could see where the water went.

The water came out of the mountain on the other side with such a thunderous sound, the waters roaring, cascading and so frothy that it looked like a dragon was spewing it out. The name of the temple, [[Dragon's Breath Temple| Dragon's Breath]] made complete sense now. 

The majestic structure that is the temple of Bahamut stands on top of Mount Lengse. 

Next year too, there would be celebrations but the tone would be more somber and fiery and a show of pride since [[Lord Verglas]] would have to hand the control back to the [[Adachi Clan]],
