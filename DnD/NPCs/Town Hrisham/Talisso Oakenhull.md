Job: [[Woodworker]]
Affiliation: [[Artisan's Guild]]
Town: [[Hrisham]]

In his 50s, this heavy bearded dwarf has retired into the laid back town of [[Hrisham]]. Once a very well known name in the wealthy circles of the country, this amazing woodworker decided to spend these years of his life in exploring the customs and traditions of every corner of this land including his own ancestry that he has just recently understood belongs to the lands to the north.

He was exploring all the artistic signatures of other cultures when he came across one which had a similar design as one of his family heirloom. He is making up his mind to go explore those lands now.
