Every NPC is born when your player engage with them.
Every NPC dies when your players stop interacting with them.

An NPC has two properties:
1. Motivation
2. Personality

These 2 things should be enough for you to play them. You do not need to flesh out their entire lives to play them. Everything else can be made on the spot if necessary.
