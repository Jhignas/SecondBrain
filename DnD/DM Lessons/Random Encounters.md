Random encounters only have any effect if they are dangerous.

Only if Random encounters are dangerous do players consider the risk of taking a short rest or a long rest in a forest instead of a town.

Random encounters should not also kill your players. These are usually beasts or something which is hunting or something similar. It is not hell bent on kill or die. It will escape if things turn bad.
