Players will usually solve any issue they have using their character sheet.
That's usually what they are here for. They made a character and they will try to use their character's abilities to solve any and all of their problems.

As a DM, you need to run them up a tree (in Matt Colville's words)... i.e. remove their options make them have to explore the world outside their character sheets for a solution.

Players are akin to action heroes and Action heroes are reactionary characters. They react to the stuff happening around them. Their world needs to crumble for them to rise out of the ashes.
