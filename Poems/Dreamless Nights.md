Dreamless nights,
	where have you gone?
Dreamless nights,
	I miss you.
Dreamless nights,
	whom did you leave me with?
Dreamless Nights,
	I miss you

I woke up gasping,
	sweating, fretting
Over things I don't remember no more.

I miss those days when I was with you,
	when sleeps felt like a blink of time.

Dreamless nights,
	where have you gone?
Dreamless nights,
	Are you lost forever?
Dreamless nights,
	I remember those days
Dreamless nights,
	I miss you
