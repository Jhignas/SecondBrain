These husks of people, Standing by on the lanes,
These lanes that I walk on, lanes of long lost past,
Paths paven by memories, Adorned by long gone talks,
People who were always in my mind, Now Nothing's there, 
but their husks.

People made of sand, Blown away by the winds of time.
Nothing left there, but husks of memories.
